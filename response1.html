<p class="response"> If i saw this kind of website a few years ago I would be confused at the choice of the layout, font choice and the decision to organize a website as such, but now I found it immediately as aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. This article proved my point exactly. Websites have evolved over the years, from its humble beginnings to it¡¯s now monstrous form of the World Wide Web as we know it today. The point is, this type of media progresses and moves forward, viewing back at it¡¯s past works and deeming it as a ¡®negative example¡¯ as Lialina puts it. When the personal sites and authentic sites became less popular it was not discarded but forgotten, as the wed advanced it left the older stylistic choice slip past. However as the article compares the progression of web design to fashion, the past trends always seem to find it¡¯s way back to the front lines.
